# Capstone Social LSTM project

This repo was ported over from the Argoverse Motion Forecasting repo. All the original README notes from the Argoverse repo can be found below.

This repo contains the novel code base that the team came up with throughout this Capstone. 

*NOTE: ./data* directory should be used to store any Argoverse data that you download and want to use in the Capstone code base. The .gitignore fill will ensure that none of the data that you store in this directory will be pushed to the repo, and instead will remain on your local system. This is to ensure that there are no memory errors that come up when you try to push large sets of data (50GB+) to the project repo.
